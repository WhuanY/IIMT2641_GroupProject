# IIMT2641_GroupProject
- This Repo is set for the groupwork of IIMT2641-2C(2024 Spring) by 5 Members
## Objectives 
The major goal of this project is to use the data analytic tools that you have learned in class to help you understand a topic in real world business. Your presentation and project report should demonstrate your understanding of your chosen topic. You should work on the project in groups of 4-5 students. Projects will be graded by the same standard regardless of group size. 
Imagine that you are a business analyst in a consulting company, or an analyst in the research team of a financial institution. Your report should demonstrate your capability in such a job. You can choose one or a combination of models that you have learned in this class, including linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, CART, and text & sentiment analysis.

## DataSource Selection
Our group members have made a datasets list to choose for the project.
